      <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

      <p>
        Code of conducts serve a number of purposes. One is to help establish
        and clearly communicate the sort of behaviors prioritized in your
        project or at your event, like being respectful to others, or making
        sure your event is accessible to others.
      </p>

      <p>
        They also serve a functional need, in communicating to participants that
         should someone happen to violate the code, there’s a process and support
         from organizers in place. This alone signals that you’re serious about
         the well-being of your community members, and are taking steps to
         ensuring the event, project or workshop is an inviting, welcoming,
         and safe place.
      </p>

      <p>
        Think of communities you identify with, be they a set of friends, a group
        of peers, or an organization you feel a part of in some way. What sort
        of values or characteristics do you associate with being part of that
        community? What makes that a community you come back to, and how does it
        welcome others to participate?
      </p>

      <p>
        Whether you’re leading a project or running an event, there are certain
        community dynamics that can help boost your work and provide a welcoming
        environment for others to join. This exercise will walk you through how
        to build a Code of Conduct with your community.
      </p>

      <h2 id="steps-to-complete">Steps to Complete</h2>

      <p>
        This exercise can be done individually or in a group. Involving other
        members of your community in the creation of your Code of Conduct
        helps others feel a shared sense of responsibility. We find the best
        codes of conduct emerge from real discussion with the community it's
        aiming to serve, and when it's reflective of the issues they're
        facing. We encourage you to work with other members of your, if possible.
        This can be done in person or through circulating an editable document
        that others can participate in virtually.
      </p>


      <ol class="steps">
        <!-- Step 1 -->
        <li>
          <h1>Brainstorm</h1>
          <p>
            Whether in person in a group or online, start by reflecting on the
            following questions. Take notes about the answers. Try to give yourself
            5-7 minutes per question.
          </p>

          <p>
            If working in a group online, share the questions for others to work
            on with you. One way to get started is to put the questions in an
            editable document (ie, etherpad, Google Doc, etc), and circulate to
            a group of community members for their input. Once you've recieved
            their feedback, move on to the additional steps below. We find this
            works best when the group of peers represent the diversity of interests
            and opinions within the community, even if a subsection of a larger
            group.
          </p>

          <p>
            (<a href="https://public.etherpad-mozilla.org/p/CoC-template-questions">Here's an etherpad of the questions</a>
            to get you started.)
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <h2>What core words would you associate with your community?</h2>
              <time>5-7 minutes each</time>
              <p>
                These could be values, ideals, or characteristics. Try to keep
                these to one word answers, if possible. If you are working with
                a group, it might be useful to do this as a silent sticky note
                exercise. Have participants jot down their ideas, put up on a wall,
                then see what words overlap. Take note of any common terms,
                outliers and surprises.
              </p>
              <p>
                <em>(Examples: welcoming, safe, inclusive, open, vibrant).</em>
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h2>What behaviors do you want to encourage? .... and what do you want to discourage?</h2>
              <time>5-7 minutes each</time>
              <p>
                Be specific enough to be useful here, but try not to linger only
                on the negative.
              </p>
              <p>
                <em>(Examples: Encourage: active listening, being welcoming,
                  asking questions; Discourage: unwanted physical contact, sexist
                  comments)</em>
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h2>How does someone elevate an issue, should someone violate the code?</h2>
              <time>5-7 minutes each</time>
              <p>
                Be explicit in these steps, and keep in mind various elevation
                options. It's OK (and encouraged, even) to have a few options.
              </p>
              <p>
                <em>
                  Examples: Set up a Safety/Code of Conduct committee, and advertise a bit about each person (general information, bios) including a photo.
                  Talk to or email Safety/Code of Conduct representatives at an event or email them with your concern. Note that all discussions or correspondences are confidential.
                  Call or text a Google Voice number, set up specifically for the event.
                </em>
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h2>What consequences are there for violating the code?</h2>
              <time> 5-7 minutes each. </time>
              <p>
                <em>(Examples: Asked to leave the event. Removed as a contributor from the project.)</em>
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h2>How can you make others feel safe and supported?</h2>
              <time> 5-7 minutes each.</time>
              <p>
                Code of Conducts aren't only about reporting bad behaviour, and
                the responsibility for creating a welcoming and safe environment
                is one that all attendees and participants to share. Take a few
                minutes to reflect on how you can better support your peers, and
                model the behaviour you want to see.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h2>Who decides what does and does not violate the code? What's an
                example of how this might be done?</h2>
              <time>5-7 minutes each</time>
              <p>
                Brainstorm some ideas for what the process would look like for
                participants. This could include response times, how decisions
                on reported events will be handled, where this will be posted etc.
                Articulating a clear process for attendess and participants often
                helps show your commitment to providing a safe experience.
              </p>

        <li>
          <h1>Share and Discuss</h1>
          <time>30 minutes</time>
          <p>
            Share the version created with your community for feedback. Make sure
            your community knows about the Code, those there to help, and feel a
            shared sense of responsibility to report any behavior that feels off.
            It helps make sure communities are inclusive, welcoming and human.
