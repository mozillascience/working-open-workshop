      <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

      <p>
        Your open project needs users and contributors, but how can you find them, get
        them involved, and keep them engaged and active in your community? One way is
        by creating and using "personas" and "pathways" to help you plan and test how
        you'll interact with new contributors.
      </p>

      <h3>About Personas</h3>

      <p>
         “persona” is a tool commonly used in the design world, to help create products
         and experiences that work for real world users (aka “user-centered design”).
         The persona is an imaginary user, based on real-world observations and
         understandings of actual potential or current users. The persona becomes
         real to the designer, and is used as a tool to test features and experiences
         (for example, a designer might ask “Would our user persona, Rodrigo, who is an
         avid photographer and technophile but also an introvert who’s protective of
         his private information, like feature x of our social media platform?”).
      </p>

      <p>
        Personas may be composites of several real-world users. The power of the
        persona is in its specificity; a good persona feels real, and helps a designer
        (or project lead) put their own perspectives aside and empathize with the needs
        and motivations of users.
      </p>

      <section class="example">
        <section class="title">
          <h1>Sample Persona</h1>
        </section>
        <section class="content">
          <p>
            Rashid is a PhD student in astronomy at a university in Southern England.
            He’s outgoing and a snappy dresser, favoring skinny jeans and colorful
            cardigans. He lives in on-campus housing and after a long day at the lab
            he usually rushes home to see his wife and infant son.
          </p>
          <p>
            Rashid took an intro Java programming course long ago,
            as an undergrad, but his research now demands Python skills. Because of the competitive nature of his lab, he’s reluctant to ask colleagues for help.
            He follows Mozilla Science Labs on Twitter, has some exposure to and interest to Open
            Science, but is hesitant to share his data for fear of being “scooped” on an important discovery.
          </p>

      <h3>About Pathways</h3>

      <p>
        Once we have a persona, we can imagine how they might interact with our project.
        Let's imagine that this process has a few phases.
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li><strong>Discovery</strong> - How they first hear about the project or group.</li>
        <li><strong>First Contact</strong> - How they first engage with the project or group, that intial interaction.</li>
        <li><strong>Participation</strong> - How they first participate or contribute.</li>
        <li><strong>Sustained Participation</strong> - How their contribution or involvement can continue.</li>
        <li><strong>Networked Participation</strong> - How they may network within the community.</li>
        <li><strong>Leadership</strong> - How they may take on some additional responsibility on the project, or begin to lead.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        If we've constructed a good persona, we can clearly see a progression of steps. Example (using Rashid)
      </p>
      <section class="example">
        <section class="title">
          <h1>Sample Pathway</h1>
        </section>
        <section class="content">
          <p>
            <ol>
              <li><strong>Discovery</strong> - Sees poster advertising study group around campus.</li>
              <li><strong>First Contact</strong> - Attends a meeting of the group, and is encouraged to return in a follow up email.</li>
              <li><strong>Participation</strong> - Asks and answers questions during the help session.</li>
              <li><strong>Sustained Participation</strong> - Attends several "hackathons" sessions throughout the semester.</li>
              <li><strong>Networked Participation</strong> - Invites some of his colleagues from his lab to a session.</li>
              <li><strong>Leadership</strong> - Agrees to present an intro session on Java, and creates a learning resource
                to contribute to the group's repo.
              </li>
            </ol>
          </p>
        </section>
      </section>


      <p>
        As you create your pathway, ask yourself, what needs to be in place to move your persona
        along this pathway? What are the potential pitfalls for your persona, in terms of skills,
        time, motivations? Once you have a sense of this story, you might list solutions to any
        challenges. Here are examples:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Publicize group meetings via posters around campus as well as on twitter and via email blasts.</li>
        <li>Collect emails of new group attendees for follow up messages.</li>
        <li>Offer an online intro to GitHub for those who join mid-semester and missed the first sessions.</li>
        <li>Schedule meetings for daytimes and early evenings to avoid conflicts with family schedules.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="steps-to-complete">Steps to Complete</h2>

      <ol class="steps">
        <!-- Step 1 -->
        <li>
          <h1>Brainstorm</h1>
          <p>
            In groups of two, read through the following questions. Take notes! Each person
            should answer the question in caps in the time provided. Use a timer to keep
            time for each person.
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <h2>Who is the person you most need in your community or on your project?</h2>
              <time>3 minutes each</time>
              <p>
                Think of skills and attributes, but also give them identifying details.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <h2>What are that person's motivations and needs?</h2>
              <time>3 minutes each</time>
              <p>
                Think of what might draw them to your project, what is the value for them?
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <!-- Step 2 -->
        <li>
          <h1>Write</h1>
          <time>3-4 minutes each</time>
          <p>
            Create a short description of your persona. See above "Rashid" for an example.
          </p>
        </li>

        <!-- Step 3 -->
        <li>
          <h1>Plan a Pathway</h1>
          <time>3 minutes each</time>
          <p>
            Using the structure above, describe a pathway for your persona. What are the steps
            through this project? What could be stumbling blocks for user?
          </p>
        </li>

        <!-- Step 4 -->
        <li>
          <h1>List your Solutions</h1>
          <time>3 minutes each</time>
          <p>
            For each potential stumbling block or barrier your user might encounter, list a
            solution that you'll work into your design of your group or project.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
