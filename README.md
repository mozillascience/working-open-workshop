####What is the Working Open Workshop?

The Working Open Workshop (or WOW) is **a set of trainings created by Mozilla Science Lab to help up-and-coming leaders of open science and open research projects make the most effective open projects possible, and build active communities of contributors around them.** Specifically, WOW prepares project leads for a strong launch on Collaborate (our platform for open source work) and a wildly successful local and Global Sprints on their projects. (see the below for more about Open Science and Mozilla Sicence Lab). **Read the summary below, or check out our [Workshop Schedule](https://github.com/mozillascience/working-open-workshop/blob/gh-pages/wow-schedule.md) and [Roadmap](https://github.com/mozillascience/working-open-workshop/blob/gh-pages/roadmap.md) to see what we're working on.**

####What happens at WOW?
WOW kicks off with a community event/mixer for project leads, potential contributors, citizen scientists, study group participants,  local like-minded organizations, and really anyone who’s curious about open research. 

The core WOW experience is 2 days of small, invite-only workshops and work sessions led by Mozilla staff and Fellows. **In these workshops, we’ll cover the essentials of preparing an open project, bringing on contributors, using collaboration tools such as Git and GitHub, and growing an active community around an open project.**

**Our approach is hands-on, and project-based.** The WOW agenda includes lots of time for participants to make real, meaningful progresss on their projects, and to network and collaborate across projects and disciplines.

The first WOW will be held in Berlin in early February 2016. 

####Life After WOW: The Open Leaders Cohort
WOW was designed as a springboard for a group we're calling the Open Leaders Cohort. Members of the Open Leaders Cohort (with the support, advice, and encouragement of Mozilla Science Lab Staff) work together to create projects, share resources, and build active, regional communities of open source practitioners.

####What is "open" research?
Whether you're studying the human genome, black holes, deep sea ecology, medieval music,  or alternative energy sources, research is a practice and process of learning, and creating knowledge. Researchers always build on (or transform) an existing understanding of the world. **A researcher working open shares insights or discoveries freely, makes her data available on the web, or makes the details of a new experimental technique or tool public so others can use and reuse it. By working open, she empowers fellow researchers and furthers our collective knowledge... knowledge that can be used to solve problems, save lives, and inspire and amaze us all.** The more data, knowledge, methods, tools and skills made widely and openly available to all, the better.  

####Oh, by the way, what's Mozilla Science Lab??
At [Mozilla Science Lab](https://mozillascience.org/) we help scientists and researchers (anyone from students to established researchers to citizen scientists) to work openly and do better research, more research, and make that research more useful by sharing it widely.  

We provide leadership training (such as this Workshop), learning materials and formats (such as [Mozilla Study Groups](http://mozillascience.github.io/studyGroupHandbook/)), platforms for sharing and showcasing open Science projects (such as [MSL Collaborate](https://mozillascience.org/collaborate)), and support for leaders in open science (through the [Mozilla Fellows for Science](https://mozillascience.org/fellows) and the OLC)
